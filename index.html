          Hello<br />

          I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you
          because I recently learned about a great job opportunity at
          <span id="company-name-highlight"></span> that I think would be a
          perfect fit for you.
          <br />
          Here is the link to the job posting:
          <a href="#" id="link-message-2"></a> <br />
          The openings are <span id="open"></span> and I think your skills and
          experience would be a great match for the role. If you decide to
          apply, please make sure to include my ID
          <span id="member-id-message"></span> in your application so that I can
          receive credit for the referral.
          <br />
          I highly recommend <span id="company-name-highlight-2"></span> as a
          great place to work. The company culture is fantastic and there are
          many opportunities for growth and development. If you have any
          questions about the company or the position, please don't hesitate to
          reach out to me.
          <br />
          Best regards,
          <br />
